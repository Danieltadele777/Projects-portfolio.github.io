About Me
------------
Hey there! I'm Daniel.

I am a friendly and outgoing person. With a background in finance (holding a Masters in Accounting and Finance) and cloud sales (specializing in Cloud sales), I bring a curious, detective-like personality and an analytical mindset to the table. 

My journey with data began in my family business during my childhood, where I witnessed its power firsthand. We leveraged data to forecast sales, manage inventory for our stores, and prepare for seasonal sales, leaving me with no doubt that 'data is the new oil!'

### <img src="Screenshot 2024-08-21 at 11.43.24.png" alt="AB Testing" width="450"/> 

Sports Predictor is a free feature offered to GemBet users during the Euro2024 and Copa America football competitions. Users could place predictions on specific games, earning full points for guessing the exact score and a lower amount of points for correctly predicting the outcome (winner or draw). Most rounds featured 6 events.

I conducted an in-depth analysis of Euro2024 eGamers, encompassing data from 11 rounds. This analysis included over 50,000 players and examined their predictions, points earned, accuracy of predictions, points by match or event, player type, and overall performance.
